sidebar_label: ⭐ What is NEAR?
---

NEAR is a **user-friendly** and [**carbon-neutral**](https://near.org/blog/near-climate-neutral-product/) blockchain, built from the ground up to be [performant, secure, and infinitely scalable](https://www.leewayhertz.com/comparison-of-blockchain-protocols#Parallel-comparison-of-various-blockchain-networks).

In technical terms, NEAR is a layer one that offers the speed, scalability and cost-effectiveness of a layer two thanks to its [sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption) and [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) mechanics.

In simpler terms, NEAR is the **blockchain for everyone**.

## Why Choose NEAR? {#why-build-on-near}
NEAR is a technical marvel, offering built-in features such as named accounts and account abstraction. For developers, NEAR offers all the infra-structure needed for their applications, from smart contracts to indexers. All while being interoperable with other chains.

### Simple to Use
1. [**Named accounts**](./accounts/introduction.md#human-readable-accountsaccount-idmd) (as `alice.near`) are simple to use and share
2. Accounts can be created using [an email](https://near.org/signup) or [telegram account](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@herewalletbot)
3. No need to acquire crypto thanks to **built-in account abstraction**
4. Lots of [**wallets**](https://wallet.near.org) to choose from, from mobile ones, to browser addons and web wallets
5. Enhanced usability and security thanks to a rich [Access Keys](./accounts/access-keys.md) system

### A Technical Marvel
1. Transactions are **incredibly fast** _(~1s transactions)_ and **cheap** _(< 1¢ in fees)_
2. Thanks to [chain signatures](../abstraction/chain-signatures.md) users and developers can **control accounts on other chains**
3. **Scales infinitely** and resists short-term usage spikes thanks to its [sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption) nature

### Great Developer Experience
1. Developers can build smart contracts using **Javascript** or **Rust**
2. **Simple onboarding**, thanks to its complete documentation and a multitude of examples
3. NEAR DevRel holds **office hours every weekday**, where anybody can participate
4. 30% of gas fees goes to the developers
5. **EVM compatible** with [Project Aurora](http://www.aurora.dev) _(Deploy your Solidity contracts with ease)_

### Environmentally Friendly
1. The network is **[certified carbon-neutral](https://near.org/blog/the-near-blockchain-is-climate-neutral/)**
2. NEAR **consumes in a year** the same energy [**bitcoin consumes in 3 minutes**](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/how-near-went-carbon-neutral-e656db96da47#:~:text=The%20firm%20found%20that%20NEAR,PoS%20technology%20instead%20of%20PoW)
